Nemo matrices can also be iterated over. Iteration proceeds down each column in turn. One can also iterate over all permutations and partitions. Finally, all finite field types can be iterated over.\nViews : because C libraries cannot be expected to implement the full range of Julia view types, views of matrices in Nemo can only be constructed for submatrices consisting of contiguous blocks in the original matrix.\nmap and similar : we implement the map and similar interfaces with the caveat that we generally use parent objects where Julia would use types. See the specific documentation for the module of interest to see details.\nzero and one : these are implemented for parent types, which is not what Julia typically expects. Exceptions include the Flint ZZRingElem and QQFieldElem types, as their parents are not parameterised, which makes it possible to implement these functions for the types as well as the parents.\nrand : we have a Nemo specific rand interface, which passes the tail of a given rand invocation to the rand function for the base ring, e.g. to create random matrix elements or polynomial coefficients and so on. In addition to this custom rand interface, we also support much of the Julia rand interface, with the usual caveat that we use parent objects instead of types where necessary.\nserialisation : unfortunately this is currently NOT implemented by Nemo, but we would certainly like to see that done in the future. It's not automatic because of the C objects that underly many of our constructions.\nNumber : Nemo number types do NOT belong to Julia's Number hierarchy, as we must make all our ring element types belong to our RingElem abstract type. To make some Julia Number types cooperate with Nemo, we define the unions RingElement and FieldElement which include some Julia types, such as BigInt and Rational{BigInt}, etc. Note that fixed precision integer types cannot be expected to be well-behaved when they overflow. We recommend using Nemo integer types if one wants good performance for small machine word sized integers, but no overflow when the integer becomes large (Nemo integers are based on Flint's multiprecision ZZRingElem type).\nhash : we implement hash functions for all major element types in Nemo.\ngetindex/setindex!/typed_hvcat : we implement these to access elements of Nemo matrices, however see the note below on row major representation. In  addition, we allow creation of matrices using the notation R[a b; c d] etc. This is done by overloading typed_hvcat for the parent object R instead of a type as Julia would normally expect. This produces a Nemo matrix rather than a Julia one. Note that when passed a type, Julia's typed_hvcat can only construct Julia matrices for Nemo types such as ZZRingElem and QQFieldElem where elements can be constructed from types alone.","category":"page"},{"location":"developer/interfaces/","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"Many other Julia interfaces are either not yet implemented or only very partially implemented.","category":"page"},{"location":"developer/interfaces/#Column-major-vs-row-major-matrices","page":"Interfaces","title":"Column major vs row major matrices","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"developer/interfaces/","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"Whereas Julia uses column major representation for its matrices, Nemo follows the convention of the C libraries it wraps and uses row major representation.
